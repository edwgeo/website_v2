# Release Notes
## 0.1 - Beginnings
#### Changes made:
- Edited content of About Me and latest experience (Neoboard)
- Edited the Navbar by changing the "Services" to "Experiences", by changing the link in the navbar and the id of the services section to experiences.

#### Changes to be made:
- Input the other experiences (Pure Storage, Pixelworks)
- Input other sections (Projects, Education); should be as simple as adding the new section tag and making the id whatever the new section's name is, and adding a new link in the navbar.
- Picture at the top/about me section (thinking about a circular image that is between the currently blue header and the content below)
- Change the header to be an image or something
